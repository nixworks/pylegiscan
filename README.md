Python Interface to LegiScan API
================================

Python module for interacting with [LegiScan API](http://legiscan.com/legiscan)
to download information about bills in state legislatures.  This module works
with the "pull API".  You must have an API key to use this module. Register for
a key at [LegiScan API](http://legiscan.com/legiscan).

Functions essentially follow the format described in the 
[API User Manual](http://legiscan.com/misc/LegiScan_API_User_Manual.pdf).


Examples
--------

Read the API User Manual and start by typing `help(LegiScan)` to familiarize
yourself with the available functions.  Here are some examples to get you
started using the module.

Tell the API who you are and search for abortion legislation in the Texas state
legislature for current year...

    from pylegiscan import LegiScan
    legis = LegiScan('MY_API_KEY_GOES_HERE')
    bills = legis.search(state='tx', query='abortion')
    bills['summary']  # how many results did we get?
    
    # print the bill titles
    for b in bills['results']:
        print b['title']

Get more detailed information for the first search result...

    bill_id = bills['results'][0]['bill_id']
    bill_detail = legis.get_bill(bill_id=bill_id)

Figure out who the first sponsor of the bill is...

    people_id = bill_detail['sponsors'][0]['people_id']
    sponsor = legis.get_sponsor(people_id)
    print sponsor['name']

You can put your API key in the `LEGISCAN_API_KEY` environment variable and
create a new instance of `LegiScan` without passing a key.
